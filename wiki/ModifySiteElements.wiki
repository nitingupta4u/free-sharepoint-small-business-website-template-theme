The procedure to modify the CSS of the site is exactly the same as that of master pages, except that the location of CSS on the site is different.

  * The Site CSS is located in the style library.
  * To browse to the CSS, go to Site Actions -> View All Site Content

  * Click on Style Libray -> en-us -> Themable -> Core Styles

  * The file *!BrickRed.!SmallBusiness* is the site CSS and can be modified according to the requirements.
