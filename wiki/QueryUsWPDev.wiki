    * *Constants.cs* is the class that contains all the constant values used in the solution. 
      * The default values of Admin Mail and Self Mail content / subject which are there in the configuration list are also stored in this class. 
      * Also, the list item identity names for these mail objects are placed in this class.
    * There are pre defined tokens stored in the configuration list. Administrators can use these tokens in either the Admin mail body, Self Mail body, Admin mail subject or Self Mail subject.
